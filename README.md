# Fall 2024 message board lecture

The goal of this lecture is to build a working information system from the ground up that covers a variety of real world use cases, including an auth system.

I will be creating a branch at the end of every lecture called `lecture-1` etc. which marks where we left off at the _end_ of each class session.
